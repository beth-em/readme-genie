## Description
README.md Genie is designed to help students or other individuals who are interested in the fundamentals of coding which begins with understanding the creation of a README.md file and how to generate a high-quality and descriptive file on your own. 
    - Why did you build this project? 
          A README.md file is essentially a book cover for your projects, if you generate a dull, simple file with limited information, it is likely you will not have many users interested in reviewing or much less wanting to contribute to your project. This file is an introduction to not only your project but you as a developer, by being capable of generating a high-quality README.md file, you can open yourself to new opportunities. 
    - What problem does it solve? 
        by including step-by-step instructions on how to get set-up for this project, users can also reference these same techniques and answer questions or problems they may run into with other projects they are working on or intending to create.
    - What did you learn?
        I learned that the thought of creating projects pertaining to software develpment is incredibly overwhelming but as soon as i get started, I don't want to stop. There is also a lot of repitition within the functions we use in coding that it makes new lessons make more sense, occassionally...there is still a great deal of confusion some of the time but projects like these are very helpful.

## Installation'
To generate a README.md file, you need to have the following downloaded: VS Code and Node.js, in addition to these applications you will need to provide an email address and create a GitHub account if you don't already have one.

## Usage
First, we need to clone the repository by going into GitHub and copying the SSH link to our clip board, we will paste this into our computer's terminal by running 'git clone https://github.com/repo/url.git. Next, we will navigate to our new project's directory by running 'cd name-of-new-project' and install our dependencies which will include node_modules and package-lock.json. Then, we will run 'npm start' to run the application.

## Contributing
If you would like to contribute to this project, you can start by forking this repository by running 'git clone https://url-of-repo.git, once you have done so, run 'cd name-of-project' to move into that projects directory. Once you are in the directory, create a new branch for your changes by running 'git checkout -b new-branch-name'. As a contributor, make sure your code is clean and formatted properly before pushing your changes. It also recommended that you run tests routinely to verify everything is functioning correctly. Once you are ready to commit, run 'git commit -m "here you will add a descriptive message of the changes you are committing". Now, we can finally push our changes and create a PR request for the administrator of this repository to review. To do this, run 'git push origin name-of-new-branch'. Keep in mind you should never push your changes into the main branch, you need to consistently create new branches and push them so other contributors can see your progress. 

## Tests
To test your changes and review the funcionality of your new code run 'npm test' and work from there. Should you have any errors pop up, solve them before pushing your request.
